A new member joins the movement, bringing new technologies in tow. Visceral
Realists perform November 16th, 2023 at Young Ethel's in the Park Slope
neighborhood of Brooklyn. Performing Visceral Realists were Jessica Garson and
Zona Zanjeros. The sonic mayhem created by the two culminated in Garson
revealing a hammer and beginning to smash a laptop. Zanjeros and an
enthusastic audience member joined in the destruction. Keys and laptop parts
were distributed to the crowd afterward.
