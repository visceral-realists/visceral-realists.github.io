Visceral Realists perform outside of New York City for the first time. Zona
Zanjeros and Andy Borsz take the bus to Baltimore to perform at True Vine
Records. The show was promoted lovingly with hand made flyers but comically
overpriced for a record store show without a functioning restroom. The Visceral
Realists fit perfectly in on a bill of solo noise performers and hardcore
bands. Borsz chews and spits bite-sized pieces from a styrofoam block into the
crowd. Zanjeros lays on the floor like a child with their legs in the air. The
moments are captured ephemerally on social media. As has been typical of the
duo, Zanjeros used Tidal Cycles and Borsz performed with Pure Data. Due to less
than stellar archival processes, the code is lost.
